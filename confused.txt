Response processor result: Here's a summary of the latest developments in artificial intelligence:

Recent advancements in AI include the release of DeepCogito v2, an open-source AI model with improved logical reasoning and task planning capabilities. AI is also making strides in practical applications, such as the use of generative AI to design compounds that effectively combat drug-resistant bacteria.

On the commercial and societal fronts, AI continues to expand its influence. Malaysia has launched Ryt Bank, its first AI-powered bank, and Google has introduced Veo 3, new AI video creation tools. There are also significant discussions and predictions regarding the future of AI, with some experts, like SoftBank's chief, forecasting the emergence of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) within the next ten years. Simultaneously, there are ongoing considerations about AI's profound impact on law, ethics, and human dignity. Fundamental research also continues, with discoveries such as bees utilizing flight movements to enhance brain signals for pattern recognition, which could offer insights for AI development.
