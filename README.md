- **Agent Management**: Create, configure, and manage autonomous agents.
- **Team Management**: Create and manage teams of agents.
- **Workflow Management**: Define and execute workflows for agents and teams.
- **Memory Management**: Manage agent memory and knowledge.
- **Tool Interaction**: Interact with tools and APIs.
